# Building a k-means clustering model using BigQuery ML

This tutorial walks you through creating an AI Platform notebook to complete these steps, providing prescriptive guidance and step-by-step procedures. 

- Process customer data into the correct format for creating a k-means clustering model.
- Create, train, and deploy the k-means model by using BigQuery ML.
- Iterate on the model to develop a version that creates the optimal number of clusters.
- Analyze the clusters that the model has produced to understand what they tell you about your customer segments.
- Get predictions from the deployed model to assign customers to their appropriate clusters.

This guide is intended for data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts who build ML datasets and models to support business decisions. It assumes that you have basic knowledge of the following:

- Machine learning concepts
- Python
- Standard SQL
